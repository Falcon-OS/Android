the Falcon trees, use a command like this: 
```
   $ repo init -u https://github.com/Falcon-OS/Android -b Skyline-1.1 
``` 
Then to sync up: 
```
   $ repo sync --force-sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle 
``` 
Building the source 
--------------- 

The source at Falcon is well configured for building. You can choose to build with or without gapps included. 
```
   $ . build/envsetup.sh 
``` 
Make / Lunch 
```
   $ lunch aosip_device-userdebug 
``` 
Eat / Build
```
  $ time m fly
``` 
If you would like to include gapps in your build, after lunching device enter 
```
  $ export WITH_GAPPS=true 
```
